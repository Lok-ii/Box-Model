    This last line is also inside a <div> tag and just some text is written and two buttons are created using the <button> tag, the first button is normal but the second button contains a <a> tag inside the <button> tag to create a hyperlink. Then the same thing is repeated to give these buttons some border and the border color and some dimensions like width and height. Margin is also used to shift the element accordingly.
